# Music

In addition to my work as a kernel researcher, I am a professional orchestral conductor.

- I am the founder and music director of the [Orchestra Book Club](https://www.orchestrabookclub.org)
- I am the assistant conductor of the [Apollo Ensemble of Boston](https://www.apolloensembleofboston.com)
- This year, I am music directing the [Lowell House Opera](https://www.lowellhouseopera.com)'s production of _No Exit_, a new opera by Ethan Chaves based on the play by Jean-Paul Sartre.

I hold a Master of Music degree in orchestral conducting from the Peabody Conservatory, where I studied with [Marin Alsop](https://www.marinalsop.com/) and Joseph Young.
