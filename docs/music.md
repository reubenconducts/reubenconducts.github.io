# Music

In addition to my work as a kernel researcher, I am a professional orchestral conductor.
- I am the founder and music director of the [Orchestra Book Club](https://www.orchestrabookclub.org)
- I am the assistant conductor of the [Apollo Ensemble of Boston](https://www.apolloensembleofboston.com)
- This year, I am music directing the Lowell House Opera's production of *No Exit*, a new opera by Ethan Chaves based on the play by Jean-Paul Sartre.
